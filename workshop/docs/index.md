# Welcome to GenAI Stack Workshop

The GenAI Stack is a pre-configured, ready-to-code, and secure environment that makes it easy for developers to build and deploy GenAI applications.

Gen-AI Stack Workshops are a series of workshops designed to teach developers how to build and deploy GenAI applications using the GenAI Stack. These workshops are ideal for developers who are interested in learning more about GenAI or who are looking for a hands-on introduction to the GenAI Stack.

These hands-on labs will be a combination of theory and practical exercises.
